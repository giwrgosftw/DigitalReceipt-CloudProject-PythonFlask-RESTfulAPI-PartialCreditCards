# RestfulAPI-PartialCards-CloudProject
My first App Engine application written in Python using flask that will expose RESTful API handlers allowing for linking partial credit cards to customers. A pdf file with usage examples is provided.

# Scope of the task
You application should expose two HTTP API handlers:
1. PUT handler that will accept partial credit card and customer information in JSON and store it.
2. GET handler that will return matching customers in JSON given partial details of a credit card.

# Testing
Postman - REST Client will allow you to interact with your API handlers without a GUI

# Installation
